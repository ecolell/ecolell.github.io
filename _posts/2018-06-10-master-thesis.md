### Master thesis

This two years and a half I've been working in collaboration with the Leloir Institute to build a platform to simplify the calculus of protein coevolution. The platform brings a way to configure and run multiple algorithms and a pretty interactive interface to analyze the results. Last, we provided an API access so anyone is able to integrate this protein coevolution calculus as a step of their more complex process.

[Here](http://ecolell.github.io/assets/docs/masterthesis/thesis.pdf) is available my master thesis about Bioinformatics and Biology Systems. Also I have updated my resume you can read my [resume](http://ecolell.github.io/assets/docs/cv/model2/cv2.en.pdf).
