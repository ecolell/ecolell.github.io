### Master thesis

This two years and a half I have been working in collaboration with the [Structural Bioinformatic Unit of the Leloir Institute](http://www.leloir.org.ar/marinobuslje/) to build a platform that allow running multiple algorithms to estimate protein coevolution.
The platform brings a simplified way to configure and run multiple algorithms and a pretty interactive interface to analyze the results. Last, we provided an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) access so anyone is able to integrate this algorithms as a step of their more complex process.
