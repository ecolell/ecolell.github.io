### Amphipathicity into MISTIC2

Last year, MISTIC2 incorporated an amphipathicity analysis library to expand the platform capabilities. This allows to color the PDB structure with two new measurements, a *Local Hidrophobic Mean* or an *Amphipathic Index*. The Python library is reachable under a MIT License in Github.
